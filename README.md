# Repository Overview

This repository contains two exercises that cover the following tasks:

## Exercise 1: Kafka Event Producer and Consumer APIs

In this exercise, you'll find two Python programs that have been containerized to create APIs for producing and consuming events from a Kafka topic locally. These programs are designed to demonstrate how to work with Kafka in a containerized environment.

### Program Details:

- **Producer API**: This program provides a FastAPI-based API that produces events and sends them to a Kafka topic.

- **Consumer API**: This program provides a FastAPI-based API that consumes events from a Kafka topic.

## Exercise 2: Azure Redis Cache Terraform Module

In this exercise, you'll find a Terraform module that simplifies the provisioning of an Azure Redis Cache service with support for private endpoints.

### Module Details:

The Terraform module allows you to create an Azure Redis Cache service with private endpoint support or Vnet injection. This module abstracts the underlying configuration and resources required to set up the Redis Cache service securely within a virtual network.
